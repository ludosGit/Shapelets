GENetic DIscovery of Shapelets
------------------------------

In the time series classification domain, shapelets are small subseries
that are discriminative for a certain class. It has been shown that by
projecting the original dataset to a distance space, where each axis
corresponds to the distance to a certain shapelet, classifiers are able
to achieve state-of-the-art results on a plethora of datasets.

This repository contains an implementation of ``GENDIS``, an algorithm
that searched for a set of shapelets in a genetic fashion. The algorithm
is insensitive to its parameters (such as population size, crossover and
mutation probability, â€¦) and can quickly extract a small set of
shapelets that is able to achieve predictive performances similar (or
better) to that of other shapelet techniques.

Installation
------------

We currently support Python 3.5 & Python 3.6. For installation, there
are two alternatives:

1. Clone the repository ``https://github.com/IBCNServices/GENDIS.git``
   and run ``(python3 -m) pip -r install requirements.txt``
2. GENDIS is hosted on PyPi. You can just run
   ``(python3 -m) pip install gendis`` to add gendis to your
   dist-packages (you can use it from everywhere).

Tutorial & Example
------------------

1. Loading & preprocessing the datasets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a first step, we need to construct at least a matrix with timeseries
(``X_train``) and a vector with labels (``y_train``). Additionally, test
data can be loaded as well in order to evaluate the pipeline in the end.

.. code:: python

   import pandas as pd
   # Read in the datafiles
   train_df = pd.read_csv(<DATA_FILE>)
   test_df = pd.read_csv(<DATA_FILE>)
   # Split into feature matrices and label vectors
   X_train = train_df.drop('target', axis=1)
   y_train = train_df['target']
   X_test = test_df.drop('target', axis=1)
   y_test = test_df['target']

2. Creating a ``GeneticExtractor`` object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Construct the object. For a list of all possible parameters, and a
description, please refer to the documentation in the `code`_

.. code:: python

   from gendis.genetic import GeneticExtractor
   genetic_extractor = GeneticExtractor(population_size=50, iterations=25, verbose=False, 
                                        normed=False, add_noise_prob=0.3, add_shapelet_prob=0.3, 
                                        wait=10, plot='notebook', remove_shapelet_prob=0.3, 
                                        crossover_prob=0.66, n_jobs=4)

3. Fit the ``GeneticExtractor`` and construct distance matrix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

   shapelets = genetic_extractor.fit(X_train, y_train)
   distances_train = genetic_extractor.transform(X_train)
   distances_test = genetic_extractor.transform(X_test)

4. Fit ML classifier on constructed distance matrix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

   from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
   from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
   lr = LogisticRegression()
   lr.fit(distances_train, y_train)

   print('Accuracy = {}'.format(accuracy_score(y_test, lr.predict(distances_test))))

A simple example is provided in `this notebook`_

Data
----

All datasets in this repository are downloaded from
`timeseriesclassification`_. Please refer to them appropriately when
using any dataset.

Paper experiments
-----------------

In order to reproduce the results from the corresponding paper, please
check out `this directory`_.

Tests
-----

We provide a few doctests and unit tests. To run the doctests:
``python3 -m doctest -v <FILE>``, where ``<FILE>`` is the Python file
you want to run the doctests from. To run unit tests: ``nose2 -v``

Contributing, Citing and Contact
--------------------------------

For now, please refer to this repository. A paper, to which you can then
refer, will be published in the nearby future. If you have any
questions, are experiencing bugs in the GENDIS implementation, or would
like to contribute, please feel free to create an issue/pull request in
